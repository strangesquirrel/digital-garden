Got a bit of an urge to start a blog or something again. Something that hopefully is quite easy to publish. I've tinkered with BearBlog a tiny bit just now and I dunno, something didn't seem quite right. Now I'm trying out some sort of publishing from Obsidian. This might be quite good.

I still don't want to spend any money on this shite just yet because what are the chances that I'll get bored again in a couple of months and I'll have ultimately wasted my money? So I'm going to try and build this up slowly.

One of the interesting things (and an example of [[Spiral Time]], which was exciting), is that I'm back using my old GitHub account, and I'm seeing my old TiddyWiki digital garden thingy that I started using and then dropped back in 2021. Maybe I could salvage some of what I wrote there and add it back in here?

I can't remember much about the TiddlyWiki thing but looking at it just now I had it personalised in some quite cool ways, like it looks like I had a button that I could use to make a new page about a book I had finished reading.
