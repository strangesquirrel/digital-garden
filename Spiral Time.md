From [[How to Be You]]

Life isn't linear.

You think it's like, you go to school so that you can do further education, which will get a good starter job in your career. You'll work at that and get promoted, and get better and better jobs until it's time to retire, at which point all that work will result you having a nice pension.

So it seems like the stuff you do at the start directly affects the stuff at the end. If you mess the start up, you've messed up the end.

Spiral Time says it comes round again. You can go off and learn something just because it's interesting and that's cool in it's own right. You can then drop it completely and go an do something else. One day you might come back and rediscover this interesting thing.

Or maybe you pick things up and drop them and all seems like you're leaving a trail of half-finished stuff in your past, with nothing to show for it. But the time comes back around and actually it turns out that a little bit from this pile, combined with a little bit from this other pile, actually makes something that is useful now.

Things come back round again. It's not in a straight line.
